        <h2>What is ET 1982</h2>
        <p>
            ET 1982 is one of the worst games ever released. It near single handedly crashed the entire video game industry in the 1980s.
            It was Developed and published by Atari and was primarily developed by Howard Scott Warshaw. The game is a top down
            adventure game where you play as ET trying to avoid being caught by government agents
        </p>
        <h2>The Background</h2>
        <p>
            Following the success of the movie ET the CEO of Atari's parent company began negotiations with Steven Spielburg and 
            Univeral Pictures to make a Game based on ET. Atari soon paid around 20 million dollars (~65 Million Today) in order
            to get the rights to produce the game. It was soon developed in 5 weeks by Howard Scott Warshaw for 200,000$ and a 
            week long trip to Hawaii.
        </p>
        <h2>Public Responce</h2>
        <p>
            ET was highly anticipated and was believed to be the beginning of wave of games based on movies. Sadly things did not
            go this way. Instead ET was highly disliked with around 25% of copies bought in the intial wave being returned.
            The game was highly disliked by audiences including many children saying the game "sucked".

        <blockquote>
            <p>   People worry I might be sensitive about the E.T. debacle, but the fact is I'm always happy to discuss it. After all, it was the
                  fastest game ever done, it was a million seller, and of the thousands of 2600 games, how many others are still a topic?
                  Another thing I like to think about is having done E.T. (consistently rated among the worst games of all time) and Yars'
                  Revenge (consistently rated as one of the best) I figure I have the unique distinction of having the
                  greatest range of any game desig</p>
