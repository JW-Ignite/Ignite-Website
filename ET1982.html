        <h2>What is ET 1982</h2>
        <p>
            ET 1982 is one of the worst games ever released. It near single handedly crashed the entire video game industry in the 1980s.
            It was Developed and published by Atari and was primarily developed by Howard Scott Warshaw. The game is a top down
            adventure game where you play as ET trying to avoid being caught by government agents
        </p>
        <h2>The Background</h2>
        <p>
            Following the success of the movie ET the CEO of Atari's parent company began negotiations with Steven Spielburg and 
            Univeral Pictures to make a Game based on ET. Atari soon paid around 20 million dollars (~65 Million Today) in order
            to get the rights to produce the game. It was soon developed in 5 weeks by Howard Scott Warshaw for 200,000$ and a 
            week long trip to Hawaii.
